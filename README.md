# 👋 Hi, I'm Shannu

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student passionate about solving problems through code and building impactful tech.

💻 **What I Do:**
- 💡 Turn ideas into projects — from frontend UI to backend logic
- 🧠 Learn by doing — I believe building is the best way to grow
- 🔍 Debug, refactor, repeat — clean, readable code is my superpower
